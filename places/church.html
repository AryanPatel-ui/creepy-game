                 Candles are lit, but no one is inside.
                    The benches are warm—as if the congregation just stood up.

                    A bell rings once.
                    Your shadow kneels, even though you don’t.

                    Whatever is worshipped here
                    already knows your sins.

        <pre>
You enter the church and the doors shut on their own.

The air is cold, heavy with dust and old prayers that were never answered.
Pews face the altar, but the altar is empty—no cross, no candles, just deep scratch marks in the wood.
Every step echoes too loudly, as if something beneath the floor is listening.

The bells ring once.
No rope moves.

Shadows stretch along the walls, bending toward you like they’re bowing to something behind the altar.
When you look back, the doors are farther away than they were before.

This place was meant to save souls.
Now it keeps them.

Find a way out before the silence starts breathing…
or <span>become another prayer that never leaves the church.</span>
        </pre>
        <p>HOPEFULLY THIS IS NOT YOUR LAST PRAYER</p>
