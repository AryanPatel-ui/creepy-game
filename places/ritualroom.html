 Symbols are carved deep into the ground.
                    Too deep for tools.

                    The air feels heavy, like it’s pressing you down into the circle.
                    There’s blood—but it’s dry.
                    The chanting starts after you arrive.

                    You weren’t late.
                    You were the final offering.

        <pre>
You step into the Ritual Room knowing it was never meant for the living.

Candles burn without flames.
Symbols carved into the floor pulse slowly, like a heartbeat that isn’t yours.
The air is thick—warm, wet—every breath feels borrowed.

The walls are covered in names.
Some are scratched out.
Some are still bleeding.

You hear chanting, low and broken, but there’s no one here.
Then you realize it’s not coming from the room.
It’s coming from **inside your head**.

The circle at the center is incomplete.
Something is waiting for you to finish it.

This isn’t a place to escape from.
It’s a place meant to **accept** you.

Interrupt the ritual and leave while you still remember who you are…
or <span>stay long enough to become the final offering.</span>
        </pre>
        <p>HOPEFULLY YOU ARE NOT THE FINAL OFFERING</p>
