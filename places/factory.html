                    Machines turn on by themselves.
                    Not fast. Not loud. Just enough to remind you they work.

                    A conveyor belt carries something wrapped in cloth.
                    The shape is human.
                    The tag reads: NEXT SHIFT.

                    This place doesn’t shut down.
                    It processes.

        <pre>You enter the factory and the machines wake up.

Rust hangs in the air like a bad smell that never leaves.
Conveyor belts twitch on their own. Gears grind slowly, even though the power’s been dead for years.
Every step echoes too far, too loud—like the building is counting you.

You hear metal dragging somewhere in the dark.
Not falling.
Being pulled.

The lights flicker just enough to show shapes between the machines—tall, twisted, wrong.
When the lights die completely, the factory keeps moving.

This place was built to consume.
Now it feeds on people who wander too deep.

Find the exit before the machines finish their work…

or <span>become another sound the factory never forgets.</span>
